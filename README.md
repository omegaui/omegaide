**Omega IDE v2.3 - The Awesome Beta**

![](/res/light.png#gh-light-mode-only)

![](/res/dark.png#gh-dark-mode-only)

# Written from Scratch
Omega IDE has 
- Integrated support for the **java** programming language at its heart, 
- Modern UI Components written from [scratch](https://github.com/omegaui/omegaui-library) with some prebuilt animations, 
- Less (*Really a lot less*) memory consumption in comparision with other IDEs, 
- Been written keeping Low End Systems in mind, 
- A Tiny Core, 
- Unique Features // how about vibing and coding from inside the IDE? 😉

and is

- Based around utilizing shell scripts instead of bloating predefined build rules.

### Warning
Omega IDE is not fully fledged yet, but, it can be utilized for production.

**I develop omegaide on itself**.

### With contributions from the open source community of awesome developers we can take omegaide to the next level.

### \#OpenSourceRules

## What makes Omega IDE a unique Java IDE among others?

omegaide can build huge java projects **instantly** 😎, provided that the project doesn't uses any build system like gradle, etc.

Don't believe me? Try it yourself 

- Open your pure java project(should not be governed by any build systems like gradle, maven, etc) in omegaide or create one
- Build your project
- Edit some code
- Hit the rocket button to see instant results.

It has a beautiful text editor with code folding, thanks to [rsyntaxtextarea](https://github.com/bobbylight/RSyntaxTextArea).

The Default Swing Components use the [FlatLaf Layer](https://www.formdev.com/flatlaf)

It tries to reassemble a material look so that it is easy to adapt the highly customized UI.

The credit of having meaningful and beautiful icons goes to [icons8.com](https://icons8.com)


# When We Need It?
Development on a low end PC is slow and annoying if your *great* IDE doesn't performs well on it or it just can't run on it.
But what if you can utilize your own OS for blazing fast and smooth workflow.

Shell Scripts are the fastest readable codes that run in the Operating System's shell, thus, omegaide can utilize shell scripts 
(instead of using pre-defined build codes) to
build your projects and make that low end PC fit for development purpose thus,
making omegaide an instant IDE for any programming language.

By Using Omega IDE you can avoid

- Installing Different IDEs that **cannot** perform well on your PC.

- Filling up your System with huge number of IDEs.

- Switching through different terminal windows and the text editor to compile, spot the error, correct it and again go back, 
recompile and .... to be continued 😑.

and can

- Just Build your project by pressing the shortcut.

# How it is different from VS Code, Atom, etc?
- omegaide is totally a **portable application** with a **tiny core**.

- omegaide provides in-editor key bindings to build and run projects that utilize custom build and run scripts.

- Not only this, whenever you run your build script it highlights any error in the editor itself which comes so that
you don't even need not to look at your `build` script's output to search for any error that comes, 
(currently supports highlights for Kotlin, C, C#, C++, Python).

- You just need to click on the `run` button and the IDE auto executes your `run` script if the `build` script executes successfully.

- Uses a lot less RAM than any other equivalent text editor when used as an instant IDE.

- In-Editor minimal code completion (can be taken to next level by creating a plugin).
