### About

**My journey to create Omega UI.**
I was a newbie when I was searching the right ide to learn and program in java.
I founded IntelliJ and started working with it.
But the problem was it was too slow and resource hungry for my system.
So, I started searching for another IDE and founded **Eclipse IDE**.
It took me a while to know how to install it.
When I installed and ran it, it was super fast.
But after coding too much on it in a day, I gradually knew that it had also started consuming much memory.
So, in order to boost up the performance of my system, I moved to **Linux**.
But, the result was same.
So, I started creating my own IDE.
And after it **just works**.
I made it public.
