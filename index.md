There are lot more features to explore. Give it a try.

## Installing
Dependency : JDK 11 or above
For installation on Debain or its derivatives use the .deb installer in the release section on github.
For Other Distros download the Omega IDE.zip file from the release section on github.
It contains three files (**one shell script, one desktop entry, one image-icon and a runnable jar file**) and I think you know what to do with them.

## Editing
For Editing the source codes you can use even Omega IDE,
Just clone this repository and open the folder **omegaide** as the project root. Setup the **res** directory as the resource root and the **jfontchooser-vX.jar** as the jar dependency.

Thats all.

### About

**My journey to create Omega UI.**
I was a newbie when I was searching the right ide to learn and program in java.
I founded IntelliJ and started working with it.
But the problem was it was too slow and resource hungry for my system.
So, I started searching for another IDE and founded **Eclipse IDE**.
It took me a while to know how to install it.
When I installed and ran it, it was super fast.
But after coding too much on it in a day, I gradually knew that it had also started consuming much memory.
So, in order to boost up the performance of my system, I moved to **Linux**.
But, the result was same.
So, I started creating my own IDE.
And after it **just works**.
I made it public.
